                <h1>Testing and Debugging</h1>
                <h5>Notes:</h5>
                <p>
                    This week I definably learned a lot about the importance of Exception. The first thing is “Strict mode”, 
                    this was introduced in ES5, and what it does is that stopes you from running with errors, which it is what 
                    is usually happens in JS, so that if you have a variable, that is not define instead of using a Warning it 
                    will give you an exception. Strict mode is invoked by using the line: 'use strict'; <br>
                    As the book says the alert and console come in really handy if we want to debug our code and test it. I am 
                    not really happy about the “debug” command, it is easy to forget inside the code causing problem for the user. 
                    I personally use Brave and that is build in chromium, that means that, just like most browsers, you have the debug 
                    function built in and can add breakpoints, it is better because you don’t risk to forget some debug command around. <br>
                    The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, causing the execution of the program to stop. <br>
                    I have a really hard time understanding how the try and catch works and am looking for more code example on the internet.
