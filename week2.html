                <h1>Notes</h1>
                <h5>Ninja Book:</h5>
                <p>Most of the Things from this week where actually familiar, I already had some knowledge of Loops, Logic and Functions coming 
                    from other experience and other classes, so it was nice to read and remember some little things.<br><br>
                    One topic from this week that is actually always been a struggle for me, is Arrays. I worked a bit with arrays but I have always 
                    done my best to avoid it, I prefer hard mathematical problems to solve then having to do with arrays. But I did my best this 
                    week to gain a greater knowledge of Arrays and did my absolute best to get to know important functions like: <br><br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Delete (deletes an element from the array according to the index given) 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Length (gives us the length of the array)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pop (deletes the last element of the array)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shift (deletes the first item in the array)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Push (appends a new value to the end of the array)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unshift (appends a new value to the start of the array)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Contact (merges different arrays)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Join (Turns the array in a string) 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slicing (create a subarray slicing the existing array with the index parameter given)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Splicing (Substitute the index given to the new value given)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sort (alphabetically orders the array)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        indexOf (gives us the index of the value in the Array)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h1>Exercising!</h1>
                <h5>Working on the book material:</h5>
                <p>As far as exercise go, I did my best to work on the arrays and did that by creating the index 
                    of this portfolio (go back to <a href="index.html">Home</a> and look in the js/main.js file), then I worked my own little 
                    quiz from this week readings. </p>
