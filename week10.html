                    When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the 
                    constraints set by the application. This is called form validation. <br>
                    Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, while validation done on the 
                    server is called server-side validation. In this chapter we are focusing on client-side validation. <br>
                    <br>
                    I question, why is a client or server side validetion better of the other? or is it the same? <br><br>
                    We can use built in form validation such as: 
                </p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>Required</li>
                        <li>minlenght and maxlenght</li>
                        <li>min and max</li>
                        <li>type</li>
                        <li>pattern</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    We can also use pseudo classes such as :valid or :invalid, and use the JavaScript built in API to add validation. <br><br>

                    The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, 
                    such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to 
                    fetch resources asynchronously across the network. <br>
                    An example of fetch is when reading from a JSON file.
