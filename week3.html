                <h1>Objects and More</h1>
                <h5>Notes:</h5>
                <p>
                    This week I didn’t have much time to take too many notes or make an extra exercise.
                    I worked a lot with my team on the team assignment and that will be linked in below,
                    but as far as notes go, here you will find all of it. <br />
                    I really like to work with object, and made a lot of discovers about it this week.
                    First thing, Object work by reference, that meaning that if we assign an object to
                    a value, and have the same object to another value,
                    changing information to just one value, will change the object for both of the values equally. <br />
                    The “This” keyword, that the definition says “The keyword this refers to the object that it is within.
                    It can be used inside methods to gain access to the object’s properties.”<br />
                    The JSON is a powerful instrument, I have used it in the past and it is a great
                    way to get around with some data and can be used to populate dynamic pages.<br />
                    As far as attribute and element selectors/setter, you will find some example in 
                    the homepage of the portfolio, on the main.js file.
