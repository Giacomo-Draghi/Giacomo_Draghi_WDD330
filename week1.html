                <h1>Notes</h1>
                <h5>UX Videos:</h5>
                <p>As far as these first week notes go, I learned the importance of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Designing for small devices first
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The strong impact that mobile device ha on the society
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The importance of having a small sized webpage in order to facilitate the user
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I loved the entire videos part of this week and learned a lot about the importance of planning for small devices first, 
                    I was stunned by some facts listed as part of the UX videos, one was the entire thing about the “Menu” button and what it 
                    takes to actually have it more accessible for the user. That is why the Menu buttons look like that in this web page. 
                    (Just trying to put things into practice) <br><br>
                    One more thing that I noted from this week was the importance of reachability learned in the video and how simple adjustment 
                    can be made to make the user experience more enjoyable. I also tough that it can be a good idea, not only having what you want 
                    the user to click more accessible, but also what you do not want the user to click in a harder spot to reach. <br><br>
                    My last thought about these week’s videos goes to the importance of giving the user the right amount of work to do, just like 
                    it said, sometime we just don’t need the user to do certain things like deleting certain stuff, so e can do it for the user helping 
                    in enjoying the experience on the website.

                <h1>Exercising!</h1>
                <h5>Working on the book material:</h5>
                <p>For the book’s part I taught that it would have been better to actually do my best to put into practice the Localstorage part. 
                    So here it is a nice text area where you can write your very own story!</p>

                <h2>Story Editor</h2>
                <p>Story Name: <input id=name_input></input></p>
                <section class="storyTools">
                <button onclick="loadStory()">Find and Edit It</button>
                <button onclick="saveStory()">Save It</button>
                <button onclick="dsiplayStory()">Display It</button>
                </section>
                <textarea id="story_editor" placeholder="Write a totally awesome storyhere."></textarea>
                <section id="story_display"></section>
